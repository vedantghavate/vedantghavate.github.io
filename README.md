## Dataset
Data set  : School-age digital connectivity

URL       : https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/digital-connectivity/

  The dataset consists of a country specific survey of digital connectivity and digital access to school children at home  from pre primary to higher secondary schools across different wealth classes. This dataset having a survey of internet connection at home of the children, tells us about the access to digital services at home.
  During the pandemic, schools had to go on the online mode and that left education at the luxury of having an internet connection at home.
The data allows  for governments and organizations to distribute digital learning to those most in need.Apart from the wealth gap, the rural urban divide also plays a major role in accessibility of an internet connection.

  The logistics of delivery of internet connections, or the delivery of wireless services can be planned by using this dataset. The sheer volume of electronic learning devices required can also be estimated by the dataset, e.g. having an internet connection in a poor rural area would solve only half the problem, an electronic device will be required for such students, however some may not have access to both internet and devices.
  
Such pre-planning and logistics can be estimated by this dataset. In some cases like sub saharan countries, internet connections are less than 1% and such countries would need an extensive overhaul to provide education to the children.

  The dataset can also be combined with network infrastructure for each nation to determine whether the cost of having an internet connection or lack of electronic devices is preventing the access to digital services.Combining the dataset with network infrastructure would also give insight on the bridge the digital divide through wired or wireless technologies.

The book is intriguing to me as it provides an extensive outlook and working on the algorithms used in social media platforms. It discusses the  various algorithms, research methods, techniques and data collection principles on gathering social media data. The particular topic that strikes a chord with my curiosity is the detailed dissection of Sentiment analysis on a social network.

  I have always been curious about how Social Media Platforms manage to build machine learning models by considering the sentiments and morality of humans. The book also discusses Bipartite networks, Techniques for identifying community structure, and social network based recommender systems.
